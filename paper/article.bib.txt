Methods: Twenty-seven patients with PD and 20 healthy controls were recruited. The first 5-min measurement of HRV was conducted at resting state. HRV measurement during threatening stimuli was conducted while participants were viewing 15 threatening pictures. Spectral analyses measures included high-frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4 HZ) component, low-frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) component and LF/HF ratio. Results: There was no significant HRV difference between the two groups at the resting state. During threatening stimuli, the PD group had significantly higher LF power and LF/HF ratio and significantly lower HF power than the healthy controls (for all, P<.01). A two-way analysis of variance was employed to determine the effect of group (patient and control) and condition (threatening and resting) on all three HRV measures. The analysis showed a significant main effect of group (F=12.21; P<.01), condition (F=14.21; P<.001) and interaction effect between group and condition (F=4.83; P<.05) on LF/HF ratio. Conclusions: The findings from the present study suggest that patients with PD exhibit a sympathetic predominance when faced with threatening stimuli compared with normal control subjects.",keywords = "Autonomic nervous system, Heart rate variability, Panic disorder, Spectral Analyses, Threatening stimuli",author = "Wang, \{Sheng Min\} and Bora Yeon and Sunyoung Hwang and Lee, \{Hae Kook\} and Kweon, \{Yong Sil\} and Lee, \{Chung Tai\} and Chae, \{Jeong Ho\} and Lee, \{Kyoung Uk\}",note = "Funding Information: This study was supported by a grant of the Korean Research Foundation ( 2006-2005152 ).
