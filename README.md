# Panic Mechanisms: Understanding Near-Perfect Classification

## Overview
Mechanistic investigation of near-perfect panic disorder classification using machine learning models trained on NHANES 1999-2004 data.

## Key Findings
- 🎯 Near-perfect accuracy (99.39%) with 11 clean features
- 🔗 Body fat mass as central hub in 6 top feature interactions
- 📊 58.78% "complexity gap" quantifies multidimensional necessity
- 👥 Poor older women show 11.82% prevalence (7.69x baseline risk)
