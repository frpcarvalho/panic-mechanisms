# Panic Mechanisms: Understanding Near-Perfect Classification


## Overview

This repository contains the complete analysis code for our mechanistic 
investigation of panic disorder classification using machine learning 
models trained on NHANES 1999-2004 data.

**Associated Publication:**  
Martins, A.T., Gomes, A., Ros, A., Santos, J. & Carvalho, F.R. (2025). 
"Dissecting Near-Perfect Classification: Synergistic Biopsychosocial 
Interactions in Machine Learning Models for Panic Disorder" 


**Related Work:**  
This study builds upon our previous publication:
- [Predicting Panic Disorder with Socioeconomic, Physiological, and 
  Behavioral Markers](https://github.com/frpcarvalho/panicprediction)

## Key Findings

- 🎯 Near-perfect accuracy (99.39%) with 11 clean features
- 🔗 Body fat mass as central hub in 6 top feature interactions
- 📊 58.78% "complexity gap" quantifies multidimensional necessity
- 👥 Poor older women show 11.82% prevalence (7.69x baseline risk)
- 🔄 Resolved Simpson's Paradox in poverty-panic associations
