Top 5 Features by Discrimination Power:
---------------------------------------

1. Gender
   Cohen's d: 0.700 (Medium)
   Separation: 31.0%
   PD Mean: 1.80 ± 0.40
   Normal Mean: 1.45 ± 0.50
2. Family History HTN/Stroke
   Cohen's d: -0.566 (Medium)
   Separation: 22.7%
   PD Mean: 1.33 ± 0.47
   Normal Mean: 1.61 ± 0.49
3. Lower Back Pain
   Cohen's d: -0.559 (Medium)
   Separation: 22.0%
   PD Mean: 1.37 ± 0.48
   Normal Mean: 1.63 ± 0.48
4. Poverty Income Ratio
   Cohen's d: -0.531 (Medium)
   Separation: 22.0%
   PD Mean: 2.06 ± 1.47
   Normal Mean: 2.91 ± 1.61
5. Body Fat Mass (kg)
   Cohen's d: 0.300 (Small)
   Separation: 14.2%
   PD Mean: 26.25 ± 13.68
   Normal Mean: 22.91 ± 11.04

Interpretation:
---------------
The distributional analysis reveals that while individual features show varying 
degrees of discrimination between Panic Disorder and Normal cases, NO SINGLE 
FEATURE achieves perfect separation. This suggests that the 100% accuracy 
observed in the full model is likely due to SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS between 
multiple features rather than the dominance of any single variable.

The biological domain shows comparable 
discrimination compared to psychological and social domains, suggesting that 
physiological markers may play an important role in the classification.

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Investigate feature interactions (SHAP analysis)
2. Examine decision boundaries using decision trees
3. Explore phenotypic clustering within PD cases
4. Analyze multivariate patterns using dimensionality reduction
