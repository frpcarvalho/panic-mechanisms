DATASET CLEANUP SUMMARY
========================

Date: 2025-11-11 21:37:20

CHANGES MADE
------------
Original dataset: NHANES_panic_12features.csv
New dataset: NHANES_panic_11features_CLEAN.csv

REMOVED FEATURE
---------------
WHQ_WHD050 (Weight 1 Year Ago)

Reason: Contains 99999 coded values (NHANES "Don't Know/Refused" code)
        that created artificial 96.49% discrimination between groups.
        This is a data quality artifact, not a true clinical signal.

11 CLEAN FEATURES RETAINED
---------------------------
1. BIX_BIDFAT      - Body Fat Mass (kg)
2. DEMO_INDFMPIR   - Poverty Income Ratio
3. DEMO_RIDAGEMN   - Age (months)
4. DEMO_RIAGENDR   - Gender
5. BPX_BPXDAR      - Diastolic Blood Pressure
6. DEMO_DMDHHSIZ   - Household Size
7. BMX_BMXBMI      - Body Mass Index
8. ALQ_ALQ130      - Alcohol Consumption (drinks/day)
9. MCQ_MCQ250F     - Family History HTN/Stroke
10. MPQ_MPQ070     - Lower Back Pain (last 3 months)
11. DEMO_DMDMARTL  - Marital Status

DATASET STATISTICS
------------------
Total samples: 6581
Features: 11
Target variable: 1 (CIDPSCOR)

Target Distribution:
- Panic Disorder: 178 (2.70%)
- Normal: 6403 (97.30%)

Missing Values: 5079 (7.016% of all values)

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Re-train the machine learning model with 11 clean features
2. Verify if 100% accuracy is maintained with clean data
3. Re-run Phase 1.1 distributional analysis with 11 features
4. Compare new results with original 12-feature results
5. Update paper methodology to document this data cleaning step

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
-----------------
The removal of WHQ_WHD050 is expected to:
- Reduce artificial discrimination power
- Provide more realistic model performance estimates
- Improve model generalizability
- Ensure clinical validity of findings

If the model still achieves near-perfect accuracy with 11 clean features,
this strengthens the validity of the findings. If accuracy drops significantly,
this indicates the original results were partly driven by data artifacts.
